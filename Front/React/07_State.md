### Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components
A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). Finally, a stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.
```jsx
class CampSite extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Camper/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
// change code below this line
const Camper=props=><p>{props.name}</p>
Camper.propTypes={name:PropTypes.string.isRequired}

Camper.defaultProps = {
  name: "CamperBot"
};
```

### Create a Stateful Component
One of the most important topics in React is state. State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.

You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this:
```jsx
this.state = {
  // describe your state here
}
```
You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components. The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.

```jsx
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // initialize state here
    this.state = {
      name:"xx",
    } 
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### Render State in the User Interface
Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() method. You can access the data with this.state.  

If you want to access a state value within the return of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.  

State is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.

Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
          <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### Render State in the User Interface Another Way
There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    // change code below this line
    const name=this.state.name
    // change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
        <h1>{name}</h1>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

```

### Set State with this.setState
The previous challenges covered component state and how to initialize state in the constructor. There is also a way to change the component's state. React provides a method for updating component state called setState. You call the setState method within your component class like so: this.setState(), passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a username in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:
```jsx
this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
});
```
React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult the React documentation for further details.
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // change code below this line
    this.setState({
      name:"React Rocks!",
    })
    // change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### Bind 'this' to a Class Method
In addition to setting and updating state, you can also define methods for your component class. A class method typically needs to use the this keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as state and props) inside the scope of the method. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access this.

One common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so this becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. You may have noticed the last challenge used this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this) for its handleClick method in the constructor. Then, when you call a function like this.setState() within your class method, this refers to the class and will not be undefined.

Note: The this keyword is one of the most confusing aspects of JavaScript but it plays an important role in React. Although its behavior here is totally normal, these lessons aren't the place for an in-depth review of this so please refer to other lessons if the above is confusing!
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      text: "Hello"
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.handleClick=this.handleClick.bind(this)
    // change code above this line
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      text: "You clicked!"
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
        <h1>{this.state.text}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

```

### Use State to Toggle an Element
Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the state. However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update. This means you can't rely on the previous value of this.state or this.props when calculating the next value. So, you should not use code like this:
```jsx
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
});
```
Instead, you should pass setState a function that allows you to access state and props. Using a function with setState guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props. This means that the above should be rewritten as:
```jsx
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```
You can also use a form without props if you need only the state:
```jsx
this.setState(state => ({
  counter: state.counter + 1
}));
```
Note that you have to wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JavaScript thinks it's a block of code.
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.toggleVisibility=this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
    // change code above this line
  }
  // change code below this line
  toggleVisibility(){
    this.setState(state=>{
      if(state.visibility===true){
        return {visibility:false}
      }else{
        return{visibility:true}
    })
  }
  // change code above this line
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
};

```

### Write a Simple Counter
```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this);
    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this);
    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);
    // change code above this line
  }
  // change code below this line
  reset() {
    this.setState({
      count: 0
    });
  }

  increment(){
    this.setState(state=>({
      count:state.count+1,
    }))
  }
  
  decrement(){
    this.setState(state=>({
      count:state.count-1,
    }))
  }
  
  // change code above this line
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button className='inc' onClick={this.increment}>Increment!</button>
        <button className='dec' onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement!</button>
        <button className='reset' onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
        <h1>Current Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### Create a Controlled Input
```jsx
class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: ''
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.handleChange=this.handleChange.bind(this);
    // change code above this line
  }
  // change code below this line
  handleChange(event){
    this.setState({
      input:event.target.value
    })
  }
  // change code above this line
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */}
        <input value={this.state.input} onChange={this.handleChange}></input>
        { /* change code above this line */}
        <h4>Controlled Input:</h4>
        <p>{this.state.input}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

```

### Create a Controlled Form
Note:  You also must call event.preventDefault() in the submit handler, to prevent the default form submit behavior which will refresh the web page.
```jsx
class MyForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      submit: ''
    };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    // change code below this line
    event.preventDefault()
    this.setState({
      input:"",
      submit:this.state.input,
    })
    // change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          { /* change code below this line */ }
          <input value={this.state.input} onChange={this.handleChange} />
          { /* change code above this line */ }
          <button type='submit'>Submit!</button>
        </form>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
          <h1>{this.state.submit}</h1>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

```

### Pass State as Props to Child Components

You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.

For example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.

This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

The MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. Pass the name property in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that's part of the Navbar render method.

```jsx
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'CamperBot'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
         <Navbar name={this.state.name} />
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class Navbar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} </h1>
    </div>
    );
  }
};

```
### Pass a Callback as Props
You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.

There are three components outlined in the code editor. The MyApp component is the parent that will render the GetInput and RenderInput child components. Add the GetInput component to the render method in MyApp, then pass it a prop called input assigned to inputValue from MyApp's state. Also create a prop called handleChange and pass the input handler handleChange to it.

Next, add RenderInput to the render method in MyApp, then create a prop called input and pass the inputValue from state to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the input field in the GetInput component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the state of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the state of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.
```jsx
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      inputValue: ''
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      inputValue: event.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ 
          <GetInput  input={this.state.inputValue}
            handleChange={this.handleChange} />
        }
        { /* change code above this line */ 
          <RenderInput input={this.state.inputValue} />
        }
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class GetInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Get Input:</h3>
        <input
          value={this.props.input}
          onChange={this.props.handleChange}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class RenderInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Input Render:</h3>
        <p>{this.props.input}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

```
