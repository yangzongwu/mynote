### There are 4 basic types of NoSQL databases:  
* Key-Value Store â€“ It has a Big Hash Table of keys & values {Example- Riak, Amazon S3 (Dynamo)}  
* Document-based Store- It stores documents made up of tagged elements. {Example- CouchDB}  
* Column-based Store- Each storage block contains data from only one column, {Example- HBase, Cassandra}  
* Graph-based-A network database that uses edges and nodes to represent and store data. {Example- Neo4J}
