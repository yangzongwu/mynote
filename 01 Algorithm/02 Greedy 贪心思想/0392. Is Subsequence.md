### [392\. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Follow up:**  
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        ps,pt=0,0
        while ps<len(s):
            while pt<len(t) and t[pt]!=s[ps]:
                pt+=1
            if pt==len(t):
                return False
            ps+=1
            pt+=1
        return True
```
