### [476\. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Given a **positive** integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010\. So you need to output 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0\. So you need to output 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The given integer `num` is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
*   `num >= 1`
*   You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
*   This question is the same as 1009: 


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        cur=1
        rep=0
        while num>0:
            tmp=0 if num&1==1 else 1
            num>>=1
            rep+=tmp*cur
            cur<<=1
        return rep
            
```
