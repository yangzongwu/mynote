Related Topics: [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)


You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        if len(nums)==1:
            return nums[0]
        return max(self.robFromStart(nums[:-1]),self.robFromStart(nums[1:]))
    
    def robFromStart(self,nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0
        if len(nums)==1:
            return nums[0]
        dp=[0,nums[0]]
        for num in nums[1:]:
            dp.append(max(dp[-2]+num,dp[-1]))
        return dp[-1]
