### [38\. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1\.     1
2\.     11
3\.     21
4\.     1211
5\.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.  
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.  
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer _n_ where 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 30, generate the _n_<sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        if n==1:
            return '1'
        
        cur=1
        for _ in range(1,n):
            cur=self.getNextCountAndSay(cur)
        return cur
    
    def getNextCountAndSay(self,n):
        s=str(n)
        rep=""
        i=0
        while i<len(s):
            cur=s[i]
            cnt=1
            i+=1
            while i<len(s) and s[i]==cur:
                i+=1
                cnt+=1
            rep+=str(cnt)+cur
        return rep
```
