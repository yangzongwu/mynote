### [374\. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **_n_**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

**Example :**


```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:
​
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        l,r=0,n
        while l<=r:
            mid=l+(r-l)//2
            if guess(mid)==0:
                return mid
            elif guess(mid)==1:
                l=mid+1
            else:
                r=mid-1
        return -1
```
