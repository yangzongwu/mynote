### [893\. Groups of Special-Equivalent Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/groups-of-special-equivalent-strings/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


You are given an array `A` of strings.

A _move onto `S`_ consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of `S`, or any two odd indexed characters of `S`.

Two strings `S` and `T` are _special-equivalent_ if after any number of _moves onto `S`_, `S == T`.

For example, `S = "zzxy"` and `T = "xyzz"` are special-equivalent because we may make the moves `"zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz"` that swap `S[0]` and `S[2]`, then `S[1]` and `S[3]`.

Now, a _group of special-equivalent strings from `A`_ is a non-empty subset of A such that:

1.  Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
2.  The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string S not in the group such that S is special equivalent to every string in the group)

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `A`.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One group is ["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"], since they are all pairwise special equivalent, and none of the other strings are all pairwise special equivalent to these.

The other two groups are ["xyzz", "zzxy"] and ["zzyx"].  Note that in particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
Output: 3
```


**Note:**

*   `1 <= A.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`
*   All `A[i]` have the same length.
*   All `A[i]` consist of only lowercase letters.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def numSpecialEquivGroups(self, A: List[str]) -> int:
        for k in range(len(A)):
            A[k]=self.reorderString(A[k])
        return len(set(A))
    
    def reorderString(self,strs):
        s1=[strs[k] for k in range(1,len(strs),2)]
        s2=[strs[k] for k in range(0,len(strs),2)]
        s1.sort()
        s2.sort()
        return ''.join(s1)+''.join(s2)
```
