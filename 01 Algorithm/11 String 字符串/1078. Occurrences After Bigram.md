### [1078\. Occurrences After Bigram](https://leetcode.com/problems/occurrences-after-bigram/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Given words `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some `text` of the form "`first second third`", where `second` comes immediately after `first`, and `third` comes immediately after `second`.

For each such occurrence, add "`third`" to the answer, and return the answer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl","student"]
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we","rock"]
```

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= text.length <= 1000`
2.  `text` consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
3.  `1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10`
4.  `first` and `second` consist of lowercase English letters.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def findOcurrences(self, text: str, first: str, second: str) -> List[str]:
        text=text.split(' ')
        rep=[]
        for k in range(len(text)-2):
            if text[k]==first and text[k+1]==second:
                rep.append(text[k+2])
        return rep
```
