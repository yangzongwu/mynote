### [1379\. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-corresponding-node-of-a-binary-tree-in-a-clone-of-that-tree/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/)


Given two binary trees `original` and `cloned` and given a reference to a node `target` in the original tree.

The `cloned` tree is a **copy of** the `original` tree.

Return _a reference to the same node_ in the `cloned` tree.

**Note** that you are **not allowed** to change any of the two trees or the `target` node and the answer **must be** a reference to a node in the `cloned` tree.

**Follow up:** Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tree = [7], target =  7
Output: 7
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
Output: 4
```

**Example 4:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e4.png)

```
Input: tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5
Output: 5
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
*   The values of the nodes of the `tree` are unique.
*   `target` node is a node from the `original` tree and is not `null`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
​
class Solution:
    def getTargetCopy(self, original: TreeNode, cloned: TreeNode, target: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        self.rep=None
        
        def dfs(cloned,target):
            if not cloned:
                return 
            if cloned.val==target:
                self.rep=cloned
                return
            dfs(cloned.left,target)
            dfs(cloned.right,target)
            
        dfs(cloned,target.val)
        return self.rep
```
