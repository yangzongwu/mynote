### [268\. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Given an array containing _n_ distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

**Note**:  
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return (1+len(nums))*len(nums)//2-sum(nums)
                
```
