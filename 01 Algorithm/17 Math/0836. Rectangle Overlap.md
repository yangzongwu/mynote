### [836\. Rectangle Overlap](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


A rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.  To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false
```

**Notes:**

1.  Both rectangles `rec1` and `rec2` are lists of 4 integers.
2.  All coordinates in rectangles will be between `-10^9` and `10^9`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:
        if rec2[0]>=rec1[2] or rec2[1]>=rec1[3]:
            return False
        if rec2[2]<=rec1[0] or rec2[3]<=rec1[1]:
            return False
        return True
```
