### [676\. Implement Magic Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-magic-dictionary/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Trie](https://leetcode.com/tag/trie/)


Implement a magic directory with `buildDict`, and `search` methods.

For the method `buildDict`, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.

For the method `search`, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify **exactly** one character into **another** character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
```

**Note:**  

1.  You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.
2.  For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
3.  Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are **persisted across multiple test cases**. Please see for more details.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class MagicDictionary:
​
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.dict=set()
​
    def buildDict(self, dict: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Build a dictionary through a list of words
        """
        self.dict=set(dict)
        
​
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        """
        Returns if there is any word in the trie that equals to the given word after modifying exactly one character
        """
        for k in range(len(word)):
            for replace in 'qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm':
                if word[k]!=replace and word[:k]+replace+word[k+1:] in self.dict:
                    return True
        return False

# Your MagicDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MagicDictionary()
# obj.buildDict(dict)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
```
