### [771\. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

*   `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
*   The characters in `J` are distinct.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        j_set=set()
        for j in J:
            j_set.add(j)
        
        cnt=0
        for s in S:
            if s in j_set:
                cnt+=1
        return cnt
