### [451\. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        dict_s={}
        for ss in s:
            if ss not in dict_s:
                dict_s[ss]=1
            else:
                dict_s[ss]+=1
                
        tmp=[]
        for k,v in dict_s.items():
            tmp.append([k,v])
        
        tmp.sort(key=lambda x:x[1],reverse=True)
        
        return ''.join(x[0]*x[1] for x in tmp)
