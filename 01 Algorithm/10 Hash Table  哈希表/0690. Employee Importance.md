### [690\. Employee Importance](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, their **importance value** and their **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3\. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is **not direct**.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their subordinates.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3\. They both have importance value 3\. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

**Note:**

1.  One employee has at most one **direct** leader and may have several subordinates.
2.  The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

```python3

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id: int, importance: int, subordinates: List[int]):
        self.id = id
        self.importance = importance
        self.subordinates = subordinates
"""
​
class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees: List['Employee'], id: int) -> int:
        dict_val={}
        for employee in employees:
            dict_val[employee.id]=[employee.importance,employee.subordinates]
            
        id_stack=[id]
        rep=0
        while id_stack:
            cur_id=id_stack.pop()
            rep+=dict_val[cur_id][0]
            for cid in dict_val[cur_id][1]:
                id_stack.append(cid)
        return rep
