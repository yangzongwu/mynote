### [717\. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit `0`. The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```

**Example 2:**  

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```

**Note:**

*   `1 <= len(bits) <= 1000`.*   `bits[i]` is always `0` or `1`.

#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        if not bits:
            return False
        if len(bits)==1:
            return bits[0]==0
        if bits[0]==0:
            return self.isOneBitCharacter(bits[1:])
        else:
            return self.isOneBitCharacter(bits[2:])
```
