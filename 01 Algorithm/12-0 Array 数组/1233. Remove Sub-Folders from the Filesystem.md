### [1233\. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/)

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [String](https://leetcode.com/tag/string/)


Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in **any order** the folders after removing.

If a `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `/` followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, `/leetcode` and `/leetcode/problems` are valid paths while an empty string and `/` are not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d/" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10^4`
*   `2 <= folder[i].length <= 100`
*   `folder[i]` contains only lowercase letters and '/'
*   `folder[i]` always starts with character '/'
*   Each folder name is unique.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def removeSubfolders(self, folder: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        if not folder:
            return []
        folder.sort()
        rep=[folder[0]]
        cur=rep[-1]
        for fold in folder[1:]:
            if len(fold)>len(cur) and cur==fold[:len(cur)] and fold[len(cur)]=='/':
                continue
            rep.append(fold)
            cur=fold
        return rep
```
