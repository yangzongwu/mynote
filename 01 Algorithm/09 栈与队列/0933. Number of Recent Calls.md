### [933\. Number of Recent Calls](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Write a class `RecentCounter` to count recent requests.

It has only one method: `ping(int t)`, where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of `ping`s that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in `[t - 3000, t]` will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than before.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
```

**Note:**

1.  Each test case will have at most `10000` calls to `ping`.
2.  Each test case will call `ping` with strictly increasing values of `t`.
3.  Each call to ping will have `1 <= t <= 10^9`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class RecentCounter:
​
    def __init__(self):
        self._queue=[]
​
    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        if not self._queue:
            self._queue.append(t)
        else:
            while self._queue and t-self._queue[0]>3000:
                self._queue.pop(0)
            self._queue.append(t)
        return len(self._queue)
​
​
# Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RecentCounter()
# param_1 = obj.ping(t)
```
