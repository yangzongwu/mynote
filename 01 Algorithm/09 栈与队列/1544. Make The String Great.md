Given a string `s` of lower and upper case English letters.

A good string is a string which doesn't have **two adjacent characters** `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` where:

*   `0 <= i <= s.length - 2`
*   `s[i]` is a lower-case letter and `s[i + 1]` is the same letter but in upper-case or **vice-versa**.

To make the string good, you can choose **two adjacent** characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.

Return _the string_ after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

**Notice** that an empty string is also good.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leEeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abBAcC"
Output: ""
Explanation: We have many possible scenarios, and all lead to the same answer. For example:
"abBAcC" --> "aAcC" --> "cC" --> ""
"abBAcC" --> "abBA" --> "aA" --> ""
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "s"
Output: "s"
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only lower and upper case English letters.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        s_stack=[]
        for ss in s:
            if not s_stack:
                s_stack.append(ss)
            else:
                if abs(ord(ss)-ord(s_stack[-1]))==32:
                       s_stack.pop()
                else:
                       s_stack.append(ss)
        return ''.join(s_stack)
```
