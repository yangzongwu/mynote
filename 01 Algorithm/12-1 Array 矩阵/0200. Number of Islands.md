Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        rep=0
        for row in range(len(grid)):
            for col in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[row][col]=='1':
                    rep+=1
                    self.fillGrid(grid,row,col)
        return rep
    
    
    def fillGrid(self,grid,row,col):
        grid[row][col]='0'
        if row-1>=0 and grid[row-1][col]=='1':
            self.fillGrid(grid,row-1,col)
        if col-1>=0 and grid[row][col-1]=='1':
            self.fillGrid(grid,row,col-1)
        if row+1<len(grid) and grid[row+1][col]=='1':
            self.fillGrid(grid,row+1,col)
        if col+1<len(grid[0]) and grid[row][col+1]=='1':
            self.fillGrid(grid,row,col+1)
