### [1275\. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


Tic-tac-toe is played by two players _A_ and _B_ on a _3_ x _3_ grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

*   Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
*   The first player _A_ always places "X" characters, while the second player _B_ always places "O" characters.
*   "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
*   The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
*   The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
*   No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given an array `moves` where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which _A_ and _B_ play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (_A_ or _B_), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that `moves` is **valid** (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and _A_ will play **first**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: "A" wins, he always plays first.
"X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "
"   " -> "   " -> " X " -> " X " -> " X "
"   "    "O  "    "O  "    "OO "    "OOX"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: "B" wins.
"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XXO"
"   " -> " O " -> " O " -> " O " -> "XO " -> "XO " 
"   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "O  "
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
"XXO"
"OOX"
"XOX"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: "Pending"
Explanation: The game has not finished yet.
"X  "
" O "
"   "
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
*   `moves[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= moves[i][j] <= 2`
*   There are no repeated elements on `moves`.
*   `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.

```python3
class Solution:
    def tictactoe(self, moves: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        rep=[['0' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
        for k in range(len(moves)):
            if k%2==0:
                rep[moves[k][0]][moves[k][1]]='A'
            else:
                rep[moves[k][0]][moves[k][1]]='B'
                
        res=self.isWin(rep)
        
        if res[0]:
            return res[1]
        
        for row in rep:
            if '0' in row:
                return 'Pending'
        return 'Draw'
    
    def isWin(self,moves):
        for row in range(3):
            if moves[row][0]==moves[row][1]==moves[row][2]!='0':
                return [True,moves[row][0]]
        for col in range(3):
            if moves[0][col]==moves[1][col]==moves[2][col]!='0':
                return [True,moves[0][col]]
            
        if moves[1][1]==moves[0][0]==moves[2][2]!='0':
            return [True,moves[1][1]]
    
        if moves[1][1]==moves[2][0]==moves[0][2]!='0':
            return [True,moves[1][1]]
