### [419\. Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/)

Difficulty: **Medium**

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with `'X'`s, empty slots are represented with `'.'`s. You may assume the following rules:

*   You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
*   Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1xN` (1 row, N columns) or `Nx1` (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
*   At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

**Example:**  

```
X..X
...X
...X
```

In the above board there are 2 battleships.

**Invalid Example:**  

```
...X
XXXX
...X
```

This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.

Could you do it in **one-pass**, using only **O(1) extra memory** and **without modifying** the value of the board?

                    if r==0 and c==0:
                        cnt+=1
                    elif r==0:
