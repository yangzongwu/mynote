# 处理FileNotFoundError 异常
使用文件时，一种常见的问题是找不到文件：你要查找的文件可能在其他地方、文件名可能不正确或者这个文件根本就不存在。
```python
# alice.py
filename = 'alice.txt'
with open(filename) as f_obj:
    contents = f_obj.read()
"""
Traceback (most recent call last):  
    File "alice.py", line 3, in <module>    
        with open(filename) as f_obj: 
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'alice.txt'
"""
filename = 'alice.txt'
try:
    with open(filename) as f_obj:
        contents = f_obj.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    msg = "Sorry, the file " + filename + " does not exist."
    print(msg)
```


# 分析文本
下面来提取童话 Alice in Wonderland 的文本，并尝试计算它包含多少个单词。
```python
filename = 'alice.txt'
try:
    with open(filename) as f_obj:
        contents = f_obj.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    msg = "Sorry, the file " + filename + " does not exist."
    print(msg)
else:

    words = contents.split()
    num_words = len(words)
    print("The file " + filename + " has about " + str(num_words) + " words.")
```

# 使用多个文件
```python
def count_words(filename):
    """计算一个文件大致包含多少个单词"""
    try:

        words = contents.split()
        num_words = len(words)
        print("The file " + filename + " has about " + str(num_words) + " words.")

filenames = ['alice.txt', 'siddhartha.txt', 'moby_dick.txt', 'little_women.txt']
for filename in filenames:

```
The file alice.txt has about 29461 words. 
Sorry, the file siddhartha.txt does not exist.
